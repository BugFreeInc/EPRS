Electronic Patient Record System  
An electronic health record, or electronic medical record, is the systematized collection of patient and population
electronically-stored health information in a digital format. 
These records can be shared across different health care settings

Currently patient information is collected in a number of different ways and using different computer systems. 
Our systems are limited in what they can do and they cant always be accessed in all areas of the hospital and community sites. 
We often have a very disjointed way of collecting and viewing our patient information.
EPR will allow us to share patient information with other health organisations to improve patient care. 
This will save time transferring patient casenotes and information by post or fax. 
Multi-disciplinary working across sites will also be enhanced.
